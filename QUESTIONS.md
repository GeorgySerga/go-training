1. What is the purpose of `go.mod` and `go.sum`? Can you think of any analogous files in other programming environments?
2. When running `go mod init` on a module you wish to publish, what should the module path be?
3. What is one reason why you'd need to run `go mod edit` command?
4. What is the "blank identifier" in Go used for?
5. How does Go know which files are test files to execute with `go test`?
